# React Skeleton

This is a skeleton for a frontend web application using React. It is intended to be used as a starting point for new projects. It is not intended to be a production-ready application.

## Using the Skeleton

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url> <directory-name>
   # Example: git clone https://github.com/9-5-pursuit/react-skeleton my-app-frontend
   ```

1. Change into the directory.

   ```bash
   cd <directory-name>
   # Example: cd my-app-frontend
   ```

1. Setup a new remote repository on Github so that you don't overwrite the skeleton repository.

1. Link your local repository to your new remote repository.

   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin <new-repository-url>
   ```

1. Make a small change, then create a new commit to test the remote repository.

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update remote repository"
   git push
   ```

## React Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - JavaScript runtime
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) - Package manager

### Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

> Note: You should have the backend development server running before starting the frontend development server. Each server should be running simultaneously in separate terminal windows. This can be a lot to keep track of at first, so take your time when making changes to the repository.

### Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) - Routing
- [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) - HTTP client

### Additional Notes

Since this is a skeleton, the `.env` file is included in the repository. This is not recommended for production applications. The `.env` file should be added to the `.gitignore` file and the environment variables should be set in the production environment.
